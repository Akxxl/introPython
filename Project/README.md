Akeels Calc

My program is a calulator. My calculator can do many functions suck as addition, subraction, multiplication, division, and a greater than or equal too. The function will ask what numbers you would like to use and based on what math type you pick it will do the math type you chose to the numbers. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE*
Do NOT put any letters when the program asks you to put the numbers you would like to use. Also do NOT put anything else than the symbol required for the math option you chose.


The developer who made this program is Akeel Ali in the 9th grade at Boys Latin Highschool.

One road block I had while writing my code was putting everything in order and using the right codes I needed to make my code. A way I overcame this road block was I looked on W3 schools and found all the right codes I needed.

I would have liked to add an error system when someone entered letters into the program, but I am not skilled enough YET.
